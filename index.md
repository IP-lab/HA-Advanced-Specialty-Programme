# HA Advanced Specialty Programme in Genetics
## Practical 1 Linux Bootcamp

In order to harvest the full potential of open-source and state-of-the-art bioinformatic software in clinical data analysis, the use of Linux terminal and operating system is mandatory.

In this session, we will learn how to use [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) to navigate files and directories in Linux terminal. Ubuntu is an open-source Linux operating system.
